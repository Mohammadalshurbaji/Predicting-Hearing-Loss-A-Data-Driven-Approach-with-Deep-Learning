## Techniques Used
This project uses three deep learning techniques to process MRI images:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: The primary technique used, chosen for its ability to extract spatial features from images effectively.
- **Other Models**: Two alternative models were used for comparison, demonstrating the relative performance of CNN against other deep learning techniques.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset of MRI images was collected and prepared for use in model training.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: The MRI images were preprocessed to ensure they were ready for input into the model. This included resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
3. **Model Building**: The three models were built using deep learning frameworks, with the CNN model being the main focus.
4. **Model Training**: The models were trained using the processed data, with hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
5. **Prediction**: Once trained, the models were used to make predictions on unseen MRI images.
6. **Evaluation & Data Visualization**: The results were visualized to compare the models' performance, showcasing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
- The **CNN model** outperformed the other models in terms of prediction accuracy, showcasing its superior performance for this task.
- The results validate CNN as an effective method for predicting hearing loss from MRI images.
